-> Could create a super struct linked_list that every other object will contain (dirty OOP)
-> For simple linked list; the prev field would not be defined (can be check ez if NULL)
-> Insert can be done duplicating the object and computing the offset of each field at compile time ; then
pass the right amount to the insert function and use some pointer arthimetic to do the changes
-> Use _Generic to set the types for copying
